<h1>Writing Simprocs in Quantomatic</h1>

<p>
    How to use simprocs is covered in
    <a href="./index.html">the main page</a>, but writing them takes only a little more know-how. You can create a new simproc file using
    <code>File > New Python Script</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Here is a sample file that covers the basics:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
        # First expose the built-in features of Quantomatic
        from quanto.util.Scripting import *
        
        # Now loads the listed rules and store them in the variable "simps"
        rules = load_rules([
          "axioms/red_copy", "axioms/red_sp", "axioms/green_sp", "axioms/hopf",
          "axioms/red_scalar", "axioms/green_scalar", "axioms/green_id",
          "axioms/red_id", "axioms/red_loop", "axioms/green_loop"])
        
        # Create a simproc by using the built-in method REDUCE
        basic_reduce = REDUCE(rules)
        
        # REDUCE accepts a list of rules and returns a simproc
        #   it will work through the listed rules and attempt to apply them,
        #   until it has run out of ways to do so
        
        # Now give the simproc a name for the front-end to use
        register_simproc("basic-simp", basic_reduce)
        
        # register_simproc provides a name so the front-end can refer to the simproc,
        #   this is the name that appears in the "simplify" tab
        #   you can register multiple simprocs from a single script
    </code>

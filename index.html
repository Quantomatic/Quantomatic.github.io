  <h1>Quantomatic</h1>
  <p>Quantomatic is a
    <i>diagrammatic proof assistant</i>, meaning it provides machine-support for reasoning with
    <i>diagrammatic languages</i> (check out some of our
    <a href="papers.html">papers</a>). It allows users to draw diagrams and build up proofs using diagrammatic rewrite
    rules. It's easier to show you what that means than to tell you, so download it and try it out!</p>

</div>

<h1>Download</h1>

<p>
  You can choose between
  <a href="https://bintray.com/quantomatic/quantomatic/quantomatic/stable">the latest stable release</a> (recommended,)
  <a href="https://bintray.com/quantomatic/quantomatic/quantomatic/bleeding-edge">the latest development release</a> (status: 
  <img src="https://api.travis-ci.org/Quantomatic/quantomatic.svg?branch=integration" /> ), or you can
  <a href="https://github.com/Quantomatic/quantomatic">access the source code directly</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Quantomatic requires java to run, which can be downloaded
  <a href="https://java.com/en/download/">here</a>, or found in your package manager.
</p>

<h2>Building from source</h2>

<p>
  If you wish to download the source code directly, you will need:
  <ul>
    <li>a recent JDK (at least version 7)</li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://www.scala-sbt.org/">sbt</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  You will then need to clone Quantomatic and build/run the frontend using sbt:</p>

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/Quantomatic/quantomatic.git -b integration
cd ./scala
sbt run
</pre>

<p>You will see a number of options once
  <code>sbt run</code> is complete. Choose QuantoDerive to get the main GUI.
</p>

<h1>Sample projects</h1>

<p>The <em>Using Quantomatic</em> section below gives instructions for getting it up and running with a sample project. This section provides
  additional sample projects to get you started.</p>

  <h3>
    Stabilizer ZX-calculus project
  </h3>

  <p>
    This contains all of the Stabilizer ZX-calculus axioms and some useful theorems and simplification procedures. It also includes sample
      graphs and derivations.

  </p>
  
  <h3>
    Clifford+T ZX-calculus project
  </h3>

  <p>
    This contains all of the Clifford+T ZX-calculus axioms, (as by Jeandel, Perdrix and Vilmart's paper) with the following changes:
    <ul>
      <li>S3 has been removed and replaced with three pseudo-inverses to spider laws, as S3, S4 and S5</li>
      <li>Colour-swapped versions of rules appear with an "s" after them, for example S1s is the colour-swapped version of S1</li>
      <li>C1, C2, and C3 are lacking colour-swapped versions</li>
    </ul>
    </p>


    <p>
      Example derivations include the derivation of the Hopf law.

<h1>Using Quantomatic</h1>

<p>To start experimenting with Quantomatic,
  <em>download the sample project below</em> and unzip it somewhere on your computer.

  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Quantomatic/qderive-sample/archive/master.zip" class="btn btn-default" role="button">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-download-alt"></span> Download sample project zip</a>
  </p>

  <p>Once you have downloaded the sample project, open it in Quantomatic with
    <code>File > Open Project...</code> by selecting (or navigating to) the
    <i>directory</i> in the file browser and clicking
    <code>Open</code>. At this point, you should be seeing something like this:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/start.jpg" style="width:457px; height:301px" />
  <br />

  <p>
    You can change the font size etc. by going to the
    <code>Window</code> menu and choosing
    <code>Increase UI scaling</code> or
    <code>Decrease UI scaling</code> accordingly.
  </p>

  <h3>Graph editing</h3>

  <p>Expand the graphs folder on the left and double-click
    <code>sample.qgraph</code>. This will open the graph editor:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/graph_open.jpg" style="width:457px; height:301px" />
  <br />

  <p>You can interact with this as you would expect: Drag nodes around, copy and paste, use the
    <kbd>=</kbd> and
    <kbd>-</kbd> keys to zoom in and out, etc.. Double-click nodes (or edges) to edit data. One handy trick is to let Quantomatic
    do some automatic layout for you. Notice how there are a bunch of nodes clustered up in a particularly unhelpful way
    in the above graph? Try selecting them and holding down the
    <kbd>R</kbd> key to
    <em>relax</em> the node positions:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/graph_relax.jpg" style="width:457px; height:301px" />
  <br />

  <p>That's better! Next, have a look at the tools we have available:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/tools.jpg" />
  <br />

  <p>From left-to-right, these are:
    <code>Select</code>,
    <code>Add Vertex</code>,
    <code>Add Boundary</code>,
    <code>Add Edge</code>, and
    <code>Edit !-Boxes</code>. We have already been using the
    <code>Select</code> tool, so click on the
    <code>Add Vertex</code> tool. Notice now the vertex types at the bottom of the screen is now enabled. Pick a vertex type:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/vertex_type.jpg" />
  <br />

  <p>Since the sample project is set up for the ZX-calculus, the available types are well...
    <code>Z</code> and
    <code>X</code>. We'll ignore the
    <code>&lt;wire&gt;</code> type for now. Once a type is selected, clicking on the screen will add vertices of that type.</p>

  <p>Similar to the vertex tool is the boundary tool. These create dummy vertices which serve as free edges, or boundaries to
    a graph. These are important for creating rules. Note that these don't become proper inputs/outputs until we connect
    some edges to them. To do that, try out the edge tool:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/edge.jpg" />
  <br />

  <p>Edges are created by clicking and dragging from one vertex to another. They can either be directed or undirected, which
    is set by the checkbox in the lower-right corner. Some theories can have multiple types of edges, which you can pick
    from the
    <code>Edge Type</code> drop-down, but the ZX-calculus only allows one edge type, so no need to mess with it.</p>

  <p>The tool that needs the most explanation is the
    <code>Edit !-Box</code> tool. !-boxes (or &quot;bang-boxes&quot;) allow you to mark sub-graphs that can be repeated any number of times. With
    the !-box tool selected, click and drag around some vertices to create a new !-box:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/bbox.jpg" />
  <br />

  <p>To add are remove nodes from a !-box, click and drag from upper-left corner of the !-box to the thing you want to add/remove.
    This also works for
    <em>other</em> !-boxes. To nest one !-box inside another, click and drag from the parent's corner to the child's:</p>

  <div class="center-block" style="width: 680px">
    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/screens/nest1.jpg" style="height:275px; width:320px" />
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>
    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/screens/nest2.jpg" style="height:275px; width:320px" />
  </div>
  <br />

  <p>Just like with nodes, repeating the process will remove the child !-box from the parent. QuantoDerive tries its best to
    only draw !-boxes around nodes that are actually
    <em>inside</em> that !-box, but sometimes things can go wrong. For example, if a vertex ends up between two vertices that
    are both in a !-box
    <code>bx0</code>, it might appear to be in
    <code>bx0</code> as well. This can get confusing, so QuantoDerive tries to help you out:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/not_in_bbox.jpg" />
  <br />

  <p>The node
    <code>v3</code> above is not actually in
    <code>bx0</code>, so QuantoDerive is giving you a (not-so-subtle) hint to move it somewhere else.</p>

  <h3>Rule editing</h3>

  <p>Rule editing is similar, except now we work with two graphs side-by-side:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/rule.jpg" style="width:457px; height:301px" />
  <br />

  <p>Here the blue outline shows which graph has the keyboard focus, e.g. for copy-and-paste and
    <kbd>R</kbd> (relaxing). To make a valid rule, the LHS and RHS should have identical boundaries and !-boxes. Not only should
    the numbers match, but also the labels. For example, in the rule above, both sides have two boundary vertices, labelled
    <code>b0</code> and
    <code>b1</code>.</p>

  <p>Rules are created by selecting
    <code>File > New Axiom</code>. Soon, you will also be able to create rules from derivations, i.e. theorems.</p>

  <h3>Starting a derivation</h3>

  <p>To start a new derivation, open a graph that will serve as a starting point, and select
    <code>Derive > Start derivation</code>.</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/start_derivation.jpg" />
  <br />

  <p>This opens up the derivation editor. Nothing is happening yet because no rules have been added. Click the
    <code>+</code> button in the
    <code>Rewrite</code> pane to add some rules.</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/add_rules.jpg" />
  <br />

  <p>I usually add all of them because...why not? You can also search through your rules using the "Filter" bar at the top.
    As soon as you add some rules, QuantoDerive will start eagerly searching for matchings:
  </p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/rewrite_panel.jpg" />
  <br />

  <p>The more cores your computer has, the more fun this part is! Currently, QuantoDerive will find up to 50 matchings for each
    rule, which you can browse through using the left and right arrow buttons. Also note that selecting subgraphs on the
    left will refine the search. One you find the rewrite you want, click
    <code>Apply</code>. This will create a proof step, which you can view at any time by clicking on it in the history view:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/history.jpg" style="width:457px; height:301px" />
  <br />

  <p>The piece of graph that was removed is highlighted on the LHS, while the new piece of graph that was added is shown on
    the RHS. Rewriting always takes place at the end of a chain of rewrite steps, which is called a
    <em>proof head</em>. The derivation editor is designed so that you can try rules out, and if they don't work, you can back
    up and try other things without ever losing your work. This means that histories can branch and have multiple heads.
    To create a new head, click a rewrite step somewhere in the path, and click the
    <code>New Proof Head</code> button in the toolbar:</p>

  <div class="center-block" style="width: 540px">
    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/screens/new_head_button.jpg" style="height:182px; width:263px" />
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>
    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="images/screens/new_head.jpg" style="height:182px; width:249px" />
  </div>
  <br />

  <h3>Using the simplifier</h3>

  <p>When you are tired of applying rewrites one at a time, click on a proof head, and switch over the the simplify panel. Notice
    there isn't a whole lot to see. That's because we haven't loaded any
    <em>simp</em>lification
    <em>proc</em>edures, aka
    <em>simprocs</em> yet. These are little pieces of code that define a simplification strategy. On the left, open the
    <code>simprocs</code> folder and double-click
    <code>basic_simp.ML</code>:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/simproc.jpg" style="width:457px; height:301px" />
  <br />

  <p>This one's as basic as they come. It loads a some rules from the project into a list called
    <code>simps</code>, then it will try to apply rules from
    <code>simps</code> until either it runs out of rules to apply, or you stop it. That's what
    <code>REDUCE_ALL simps</code> does. Click the
    <img src="images/gui/start.png" /> button in the toolbar to execute this code, which will
    <em>register</em> the procedure
    <code>basic_simproc</code> with QuantoDerive. Now, go back to your derivation and click the refresh button:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/refresh.jpg" />
  <br />

  <p>There it is, ready to go. Select
    <code>basic_simp</code> and click play:</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/basic_simp.jpg" style="width:457px; height:301px" />
  <br />

  <p>Well, that didn't get us very far. It is basic, after all. Go back to
    <code>simprocs</code> and open
    <code>rotate_simp.ML</code> and execute it. Now, back in our derivation, click the refresh button again and run
    <code>rotate_simp</code>.</p>

  <img class="img-thumbnail center-block" src="images/screens/rotate_simp.jpg" style="width:457px; height:301px" />
  <br />

  <p>That's better! Of course, your results may vary depending on what nodes you added earlier.</p>

  <p>So, that's pretty much all there is to it. Play around with creating some new rules or even a new project. We'll be rolling
    out support for more theories as development continues.</p>
